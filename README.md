# Notification-Page
Hello there, welcome! This project is a challenge from frontend-mentor, which is a notification page that was built with HTML, CSS and JS;
In the original project, there are different things made by frontend-mentor but I decided to change some features. One of these features it is the color of the notifications. I changed from blue to red. What is more close of a real social media.
If you have a better solution, please, feel free to try!
